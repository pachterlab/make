###  Open source bioinstrumentation

The Pachter Lab participates in several in-house and collbaorative projects aimed at designing low-cost open source bioinstruments. The motivation for this work started in 2014, when Shannon Hateley, who was working on several experiments in the lab, decided to start 3D printing plastic containers to save the lab money. The lab's first 3D printer arrived in March, 2015 (a MakerGear M2), and we quickly realized that it was not only saving the lab money, but making possible the development of new experiments requiring custom parts. In 2016 we set up Drop-seq for single-cell RNA-seq in the lab. The DYI setup requires three syringe pumps, and while working with commercial pumps we ordered, Jase Gehring became frustrated with rigidity of the software. Even minor modifications to the default programs required firmware updates, and there was a complete lack of flexibility making it impossible to effectively program the pumps. He therefore started exploring open-source 3D pumps, and in 2019 we published our first open-source bioinstrument, the [poseidon syringe pump](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-48815-9). The work was led by Sina Booeshaghi who now heads the Maker Lab in our group.

We are committed to developing open source bioinstruments for use in the wet lab that satisfy numerous design criteria we outlined in our poseidon paper. We strive to make the instruments easy to assemble, low-cost, safe, modular and robust.
